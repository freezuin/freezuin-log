# **Daily Plan**

of the 4th quarter of 2025

***Logan Lee***

This is a memo which provides daily guidelines for determining what tasks to do and how to schedule them.

The **Key Principles of Planning** are as follows:

- A **day** is divided into `3` **sessions**.
- Each **session** consists of approximately `3` hrs.
- Each **session** must contain multiple (at least `2`) **tasks**.
- The allotted time for each **task** should not exceed `1.5` hrs.

Here is a suggested time-slot:

- **M** 8:30-11:30 a.m. or 9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.
- **A** 2:00-5:00 p.m. or 2:30-5:30 p.m.
- **E** 7:00-10:00 p.m. or 6:30-9:30 p.m.

When the majority of the tasks in M / A / E are accomplished, you might want to check the box. To be fair, Checking them all is challenging, so no big deal if only a couple are done. Keep it up!

> Today seems quite successful, except for the fact that I was too exhausted to finish the work of the last part.
> One thing I hate is to be inefficient, spending excessive time to comprehend and memorize by heart every new technical term I came accross, although I've discovered that as you dig deeper into the terminologies, the entire landscape of knowledge intertwined with it begins to reveal itself. This is a wonderful process which triggers your curiosity, yet inevitably speaks for low-efficiency.
> I do feel like no matter what you learn -- science or humanities -- it is always the "language" that gets in the way, and it's the most time-consuming one to understand and memorize. Terminologies are kind of a language, I guess. They are highly condensed blocks of knowledge, which appears unworldly, but as a matter of fact are benevolent when broken down.

> I didn't know for what reason do I stay up till 2'o clock in the morning and screw up everything I have organized for today. These irresponsible behaviors do happen sometimes. But I'm not even depressed or anything! My suggestion would be, sleep when it's time to. Don't hesitate!
> Nevertheless, today is of tremendous productivity. I tried to diminish the time for accomplishing each task, so that I could have larger freedom for other arrangements. The result didn't come off flawless, however, as much of my arrangements were sabotaged out of the unexpected failure in sleeping in time.
